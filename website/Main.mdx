## Presets

It provides ready-to-use `<DateSelect />` component for each UI library, exported from `react-ymd-date-select/presets/*`.

`react-ymd-date-select/presets/vanilla` is a bare HTML version without styling.

<VanillaSample />

`react-ymd-date-select/presets/(chakra-ui|mui)` is also available for [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and [Material UI](https://mui.com/).

<VariantSamples />

## Hook for custom components

This library also provides `useDateSelect` hook so that you can create original customized components.

import HookSampleCode from "./components/hook-sample/hook?raw";

<CodePreview initialCode={HookSampleCode} language="tsx" />

## With form libraries

### React Hook Form

import ReactHookFormSampleCode from "./samples/react-hook-form?raw";

<CodePreview initialCode={ReactHookFormSampleCode} language="tsx" />

For the details about the usage with React Hook Form,
see [the "Controlled mixed with Uncontrolled Components" section](https://react-hook-form.com/advanced-usage#ControlledmixedwithUncontrolledComponents) in the official document.
Since the date selector is a controlled component, we need to use the `<Controller />` provided from React Hook Form as the example above.

### Formik

import FormikSampleCode from "./samples/formik?raw";

<CodePreview initialCode={FormikSampleCode} language="tsx" />

Note that you have to use `setFieldValue()` in the `onChange` prop of `<DateSelect />` instead of directly passing the `field.onChange` prop.
It is because `<DateSelect />`'s `onChange` is called with a `string` value but not with an event and it does not match Formik's `onChange`.
